### A website about different African artists, their work and their struggles.

üåç : I did this project in 2021 with the help of 5 other African girls from different countries. It was our first experience in website development and we did it in less than 5 days. 

I presented this project on the Star Girl Africa program's demo day on behalf of my team and won the " best website development project " award as our website was chosen by the judges. 

We also did the creative process, logo design, artists interviews and content writing by ourselves in such a short period of time.

It was one of my favorite and most memorable experiences in programming in general.
