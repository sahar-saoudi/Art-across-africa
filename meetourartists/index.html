  <h2><u>Ofentse Maokaneng aka Thee Advocate</u></h2>
  <p>Ofentse is a young poet from Botswana but, as art seems to know no bounds, he is also a singer, a motivational
    speaker and an entrepreneur. With nothing but his talent and drive to lean on, he managed to successfully build a
    brand for himself. Ofentse is widely inspired by his personal thoughts, experiences, his love for poetry as well
    as the unconditional support from his fanbase. It is simply one of the many things that keep him motivated and more
    often
    than not, pulls him out of any challenges he faces through his journey. </p>
