      <h4>
      <ol>
        <li id="headings"><u>Exploitation of artists.</u></li><br>
        <p>In many countries for instance in Kenya, collective management organisations(CMOs) and Digital Streaming Platforms are notoriously know to exploit artist monies (their incomes) by giving them a significantly smaller portion of their earning while spending the recklessly spending the remaining funds on management of the organisations as revealed by the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO).
Because of this artists resort to independent means, avoiding these organisations all together, to promote their own music (that requires a colossal amount of time, work and sacrifices), reducing their chances of success and making them subject to multiple risks like piracy of their music.
</p>
      <li id="headings"><u>lack of representation.</u></li><br>
        <p>This is an issue that cuts across the board for all the subsections of this industry. For instance, in the creative art industry lack of adequate representation leads to artists selling their art for prices below their fiscal worth, they are only to make a small earning no matter how small the earning. 
For similar reasons, authors do not write their true creative ideas or poets do not compose authentic poems, i.e poems or stories deeply rooted in African culture; stories,languages; simply because they will not sell -people may find it hard to understand. Consequently, they end up being restricted to writing stories and poems that are contrived to international norms, that are easy to understand, because they are easier to sell. This as a result reduces the diversity in our continents exported art.
</p>
      <li id="headings"><u>Inadequate resources.</u></li><br>
        <p>Artists across the continent are burdened not only to deal with the above issues but also to face the obstacle of inadequate resources in this industry. For instance, in Uganda creative artists face the hurdle of inadequate funding for their craft, in Kenya creative artists face the same issue as well as in other parts of Africa and in other sectors in the art industry for instance, for poets and writers. 
This is due to the lack  proper of unifying or engagement platforms to advocate for these artists. Without any support, it becomes harder for artists to ask for loans from banks, their chances of actually acquiring the loan are dangerously slim. This is because these banks try to establish means by which they can regain their money before investing in your idea -  without a recognised body advocating for your ‘business’ they are less likely to trust in your business idea it is not considered a priority.
As a result artists never fully focus on their work, they are more likely to have a side hustle that they can bounce back on in case their passion does not seem to bear any fruit. This results in poor quality art, for instance, novels, simply because the editors did not properly review the text they were asked to review, instead having their focus on a ‘main steam’ job i.e financial management.
</p>
      <li id="headings"><u>Lack of growth.</u></li><br>
        <p>Lastly, it is unfortunate to say that among the problems artists face, there is a noticeable lack of growth in this industry. This is because it is not viewed as a priority compared to other industries. This is seen by the significant development of other sectors i.e science and technology not only in schools but also in by the opening of labs for research.
This affects the artists as there is a lack of up to date statistics on their numbers so it becomes difficult for effective policies to be set, leaving them as square one.
Furthermore, lack of growth affects this industry because it may be the reason for the minute number of individuals in the industry. For instance, in school  and public libraries there is rarely any modern literature for young readers in school to even have a chance at igniting their passion for the literary arts.
Similarly, due to lack of growth of this industry, there are barely any appropriate publishing and printing organisations available for these artist increasing their difficulty at releasing published works or art this leads to these artists having to look for publishers in other countries i.e western countries that may not necessarily see the importance or value of the work, or this may lead to a difficulty in importing their books into their home countries to sell.
In addition to that, due to the lack of growth of this industry, it is not really discussed in schools, as a result a great majority of young artists lack some of the basic skills required to ensure success in this industry, for instance basic knowledge on their <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+intellectual+property+rights&oq=what+sre+intele&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i10i13l5j0i10i22i30l3j0i22i30.5396j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Intellectual property rights</a></strong>.</p>
